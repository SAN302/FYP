This repository contains experimental code for the work done in our project which is Hate speech detection and classification done by Hassan Farooq, Husnain Gohar and Abdul Rehman of FAST university Islamabad.

Project Description:

In this project our goal was to attain maximum performance using state of the art models with flair embeddings. All the study before this was conducted on word2vec embeddings. So, we decided to use flair embeddings where we can use custom embeddings too with our deep models like CNN+GRU and CNN+LSTM
